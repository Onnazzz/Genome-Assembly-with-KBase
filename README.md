# Genome-Assembly-with-KBase

The report practice can be found in the document titled Genome_Assembly_practice_using_KBase.pdf.

The SRR16201156 file can be downloaded from NCBI.

The SPAdes.contigs.FASTA.zip proportioned and mentioned is also in this repository.

Objective: 

Comprehend the concept of genome assembly, master the KBase methodology for execution, analyze KBase results by interpreting diverse metrics, and conclude the practice by conducting a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to ascertain the identity of the assembled genome.
